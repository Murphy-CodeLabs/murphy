- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with comprehensive interfaces

### Environment Support
- **Mainnet**: Production trading with real SOL/USDC/USDT
- **Devnet**: Testing with devnet tokens and mock transactions
- **Configurable**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLUSTER` for environment switching

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```tsx
import { RecurringSetupForm, RecurringOrderWidget } from "@/components/ui/murphy/Jupiter-Recurring";

export default function MyDCAApp() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <RecurringSetupForm onOrderCreated={(orderId) => console.log('New order:', orderId)} />
      <RecurringOrderWidget />
    </div>

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Guide

### Deploy to Vercel

Follow these steps to deploy your Jupiter Recurring DCA feature branch:

#### 1. Connect GitHub Repository
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Select the branch containing your Recurring DCA UI work

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Add these required environment variables in Vercel:

```bash
# Required for Solana connection
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLUSTER=mainnet  # or devnet for testing

# Jupiter API (optional - uses public endpoint by default)
NEXT_PUBLIC_JUP_API=https://lite-api.jup.ag

# Solana RPC URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL_DEVNET=https://api.devnet.solana.com

# Use Mainnet by default
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MAINNET=true

# Base URL for the application
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-project.vercel.app
```

#### 3. Build Settings
Vercel will automatically detect Next.js settings. Ensure:
- **Framework Preset**: Next.js
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` or `pnpm build`
- **Output Directory**: `.next` (default)

#### 4. Deploy & Share
1. Click "Deploy" to trigger the build
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Share your deployment URL: `https://your-project.vercel.app/jupiter-dashboard`

### Required Vercel Settings

**For Shadcn/UI Components:**
- No additional configuration needed - components use CSS-in-JS

**For Tailwind CSS:**
- Vercel automatically processes Tailwind classes
- Ensure `tailwind.config.js` is in your project root

**For React/TypeScript:**
- Vercel auto-detects TypeScript configuration
- Ensure `tsconfig.json` is properly configured

**For Solana Wallet Integration:**
- No additional configuration needed
- Components use `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` which works out of the box

### Post-Deployment Testing
1. **Test Wallet Connections**: Connect Phantom or other Solana wallets
2. **Verify Cluster Toggle**: Switch between mainnet and devnet
3. **Test Order Creation**: Create a recurring DCA order (use devnet for testing)
4. **Check Order Monitoring**: Verify that orders display correctly
5. **Test Order Cancellation**: Cancel an existing order
6. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test on mobile devices

### Local Development Setup

For local development, create a `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Jupiter Recurring DCA Demo Environment Variables

# Cluster Configuration (mainnet or devnet)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLUSTER=mainnet

# Jupiter API Configuration (optional - uses public endpoint by default)
NEXT_PUBLIC_JUP_API=https://lite-api.jup.ag

# Solana RPC URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL_DEVNET=https://api.devnet.solana.com

# Use Mainnet by default
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MAINNET=true

# Base URL for the application
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Then run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/jupiter-dashboard` to see the demo.
